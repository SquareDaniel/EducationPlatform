# EducationPlatform

Simple Flask application with login, registration and basic course management.
Users and courses are stored in a local SQLite database.

## Running

Install the Flask package and start the app:

```bash
pip install Flask
python app.py
```

The app creates `users.db` in the project directory for storing user information.

When logged in you can view and create courses from the Courses page.
